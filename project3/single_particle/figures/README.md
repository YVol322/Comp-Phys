"z_vs_t_16k_RK4.png" is a figure that shows coordinate depandence of time $z(t)$.


"RK4_analyt.png" is figure that shows absolute error $\varepsilon$ divided by initial value of $x$ coordinate dependance of time $\frac{\varepsilon}{x_0}(t)$ of RK4 metdor for different timeteps $n$. I did not understand how to add axes labels, so $x$ axis is time $t[\mu s]$ and y axis is absolute error $\varepsilon$ divided by initial value of $x$ coordinate $\frac{\varepsilon}{x_0}(t)$.


"FE_analyt.png" is figure that shows absolute error $\varepsilon$ divided by initial value of $x$ coordinate dependance of time $\frac{\varepsilon}{x_0}(t)$ of FE metdor for different timeteps $n$. $x$ axis is time $t[\mu s]$ and y axis is absolute error $\varepsilon$ divided by initial value of $x$ coordinate $\frac{\varepsilon}{x_0}(t)$.
