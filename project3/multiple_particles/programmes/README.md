# All programmes had been written by Yevhenii Volkov


"particle.hpp" & "particles.cpp" are the same "particle" class files.


"trap.hpp" & "trap.cpp" are the modified "trap class" files. Updated class has function that can implement RK4, F3 methods for $n$ particle with and without interactions.


"100particles.cpp" is the .cpp programme that implements RK4 method for solving 100 particles probleme without interaction for time dependent electric potetial
