"RK4_table_500ms_100p.csv" is the .csv table that contains number of trapped particles $n_1, n_2, n_3$ (initial number of particles $n_0=100$) after $t=500[\mu s]$ for different values of angular frequence $\omega_v$ (in $[MHz]$, forgot to add). $n_1$ corresponds to amplitude value $f=0.1$, $n_2 \implies f=0.4; n_3 \implies f=0.7$ without particle interaction. $\omega_v \in [0.2;2.5] MHz$.


"RK4_table_500ms_100p_reso.csv" is the .csv table that contains number of trapped particles $n_1, n_2, n_3$ (initial number of particles $n_0=100$) after $t=500[\mu s]$ for different values of angular frequence $\omega_v$ (in $[MHz]$, forgot to add). $n_1$ corresponds to amplitude value $f=0.1$, $n_2 \implies f=0.4; n_3 \implies f=0.7$ without particle interaction. $\omega_v \in [1;1.69] MHz$.


"RK4_table_500ms_25p_reso.csv" is the .csv table that contains number of trapped particles $n_1, n_2, n_3$ (initial number of particles $n_0=25$ to compare with interaction table) after $t=500[\mu s]$ for different values of angular frequence $\omega_v$ (in $[MHz]$, forgot to add). $n_1$ corresponds to amplitude value $f=0.1$, $n_2 \implies f=0.4; n_3 \implies f=0.7$ without particle interaction. $\omega_v \in [1;1.69] MHz$.


"RK4_table_500ms_25p_reso_int.csv" is the .csv table that contains number of trapped particles $n_1, n_2, n_3$ (initial number of particles $n_0=25$ to save time) after $t=500[\mu s]$ for different values of angular frequence $\omega_v$ (in $[MHz]$, forgot to add). $n_1$ corresponds to amplitude value $f=0.1$, $n_2 \implies f=0.4; n_3 \implies f=0.7$ with particle interaction. $\omega_v \in [1;1.69] MHz$.
